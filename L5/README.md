##Type of Outcome Measure

two classes of errors:

### Systematic errors (Stochastics)

- tendency to systematically overestimate or underestimate average difference between population and sample

- SUrvey BIAS
	- Social desirability bias
	- Undercoverage bias
	- Self selection bias
	- Publication Bias

Sulution: 
- Good exmerimental design
- Calibration (to access systematics induced by
	your measurements)
- Simulation (to access the systematics induced by your analysis)

### Stochastic & Random error
- Sensitivity error (Repeated measurments bootstrap)

- Stochastic processes
	Poisson proceses, described by Poisson distribution // lambda.
 
	- Accuracy (accurate representation)
	- Precision (small sample deviation)
