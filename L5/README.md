##Type of Outcome Measure

two classes of errors:

### Systematic errors (Stochastics)

- tendency to systematically overestimate or underestimate average difference between population and sample

- SUrvey BIAS
	- Social desirability bias
	- Undercoverage bias
	- Self selection bias
	- Publication Bias

Sulution: 
- Good exmerimental design
- Calibration (to access systematics induced by
	your measurements)
- Simulation (to access the systematics induced by your analysis)

### Stochastic & Random error
- Sensitivity error (Repeated measurments bootstrap)

- Stochastic processes
	Poisson proceses, described by Poisson distribution // lambda.
 
	- Accuracy (accurate representation)
	- Precision (small sample deviation)

	- independence test


# Chapter 1

 - corellation tests (Spearman and Pearson)
 - independense tests

 - Goodness of fit **Kolmogorov-Smirnov test**:
 - K-sampe Anderson-Darling test

 - Pearson's test
 - Spearman's test

# Lann
KS = np.nanmax(np.array*cs1/cs1.max() - mp.array(cs2/cs2.max()))


### Homework

##### Reading
- [Estimating the reproducibility of psycholohical science](http://www.sciencemag.org/content/349/6251/aac4716.full.pdf)

-  HW1: compare datasets measuring difference of corellations :  Pearson's test, Spearman test, check difference with Hk-SM test

- EXTRA: pick one of the corellations and write distr checker manually

- HW2: ...?

- Homework 3: use two tests to find if there is better describtive distribution for citibikes data
