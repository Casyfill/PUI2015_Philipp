excellent reviews, excellent plot. 10/10

NOTES ON PLOT 
[!alt text](horizont_Moscow.png)

this is a great plot. the kind of plot that makes tufte happy. 
the author should make the python implementation public in a nice python module!
the color choices are not terribly good for color blind compliance.

what is the number at the top left of each row? not describes in the readme.


NOTES ON THE PLOTS YOU REVIEWED

tz869
=====


the default 3 datapoints for scatter plot should be changes as it is unnecessarily redundant

the color difference between white and Asians is not visible and nearly all colors blend for color blind people


the thick-dashed line is not labeled nor in the legend.

the choice of thick and thick-dashed line and of 2 dotted lines in subdued colors seems to suggest the first two lines are the important ones, while the other ones are less important. 

tick labels are too small. axis labels are fine and readable

the title is excessively large, taking attention away from the plot.

diogomiura
==========

small tick labels

small axis label (not terribly small but a bit)

the faint colors may not render well in a page with other stuff in it. 

assigning shades of red and blue to females and males does enhance clarity through intuition but it charges the plot with gender issues: more neutral colors are advisable. 

the distribution of the data would probably be suitable to a log scale on the y axis. this would separate the bottom of the range, which now appears to be the same by eye for all categories.

diggity2036
===========

tick labels too small

title too small

legend too small

too much empty space (remember tufte's rules): the axis could be cut at the bottom and left

nicely color-blind compliant and the colors nicely show some structure in the data
