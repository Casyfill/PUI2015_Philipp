Plot itself is very beautiful and easy to read one - there are only few minor points to consider for improvement:

- [ ] Title should be large, labels should be small.
- [ ] I think, we can simplify the title, removing unnecessary details. You can add them into the plot itself, or write in the comments to the plot (or in very small font just below the plot - especially info on the dataset)
- [ ] please, use only one dot per label in the legend
- [ ] you don't need to feel yourself restricted to two digits in ticks labeling: no need for things like **05**.
- [ ] It might be good to slightly change color of Commercial and office buildings just slightly - now it is a bit hard to see them over the plot grid.

Anyway, plot is quite beautiful and honest in the representation, and a good one to narrate a story: we can clearly see here two models - linear correlation for multi-family and mixed use buildings, and a lot of noise for commercial and industrial ones.
