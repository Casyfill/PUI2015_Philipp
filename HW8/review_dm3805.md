Plot articulates the difference between duration of trips for men and  women cycling in New York for different weekdays. Plot appears to be clean and accurate, with no major visual problems.
  Yet, here are some points to consider:

  - [ ] colors are awesome, yet could make plot not readable for colorblind person or as a b/w print version.
  - [ ] for Y-axis label, I would change "in seconds" to ", sec."
  - [ ] It would be great to make title larger, in order to distinguish it from axis labels and legend
  - [ ] In this specific case, plot is very clean and easy - we can reduce the size twice without loosing any visibility. I'd consider reducing plot width to fit better plot proportions
  - [ ] In this specific case we also don't need frame that much - both for plot and legend. It would be great to keep only Y axis line.
  - [ ] This is totally optional. but I'd like to add some visual border between workdays and weekend days - either line or fill weekend zone with the light-gray (?) background.
  - [ ] There is no need to add more information if this plot is just an illustration to the article. Yet, if I will see this as an independent slide, I'd like to know date range for presented trips.

  Anyway, plot appears to be clean, readable and honest.
